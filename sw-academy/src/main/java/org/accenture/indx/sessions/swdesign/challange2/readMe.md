# SW Design Workshop

## Problem Statement

Product Owner would like to introduce a new SimCard campaign for SimCard Journeys.
First story in this journey is a campaign communication where the service provides different
campaigns dynamically.

It is highlighted by the product owner, there will be extra functionalities added in the future on top of these campaign groups.
Therefore, it is important to design a solution where extensibility and flexibility with loose coupling plays a critical role.

#### These are just samples, there can be anything grouped together.
#### However, for now it is enough to play with Strings as the goal is rather SW design.

Sample campaigns:

- SimCard with unlimited data
- SimCard with 3GB data.
- SimCard with 1000 free SMS and 1000 minutes free domestic call.
